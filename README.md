## Usage of the Coq code

The Coq code depends on the UniMath library, available from http://github.com/UniMath/UniMath.
Make sure to have the Coq binaries of UniMath (in sub/coq/bin) in your PATH, and that you have installed the UniMath library installed - "make install" will put them in sub/coq/user-contrib/UniMath, where they'll be found when being imported by the Coq files here.
